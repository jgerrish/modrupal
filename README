This library provides an interface to the Drupal Services module.
The Drupal Services module provides web services to Drupal core
functionality.  This library provides a set of Java classes to 
use the XML-RPC servers provided by the Drupal Services module.

The library is packaged for use on mobile devices that run Java, such
as MIDP, BlackBerry, and Google Android phones.


Requirements:

This library requires several additional libraries:

  kxml2 (2.3.0)
  A small XML parsing Java library

  kxmlrpc (1.1.2)
  A small XML-RPC Java library

  Bouncy Castle lightweight crypto library (1.43)
  A small set of crypto routines for Java

I have provided reduced versions of all of these libraries in the lib
directory.  I have also included the licenses for each package in the lib
directory.
